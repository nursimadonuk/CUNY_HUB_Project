# CUNY_HUB_Project

Attending NYC high schools we noticed there isn’t somewhere we can find information on CUNY schools all in one place. 

_It’s hard to find what you’re looking for if you don’t know where to look for it._

This is where we came up with the idea to create a hub for CUNY School information.
